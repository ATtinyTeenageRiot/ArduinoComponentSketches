# ACS-84-0001
Simple Squarewave Oscillator
==============

## Overview:
This is a down and dirty oscillator that you can use to test other circuits.  
The frequencies are fixed, so if you want some control over the sound, this is not the droid you are looking for.

There are four fixed audio frequencies and four low frequencies in the 1hz range as well as two ramp like sounds that ramp up or down in frequency.

## Equivalent:

Mostly used to replace a 40106 oscillator for a quick audio check.
