# ACS-85-0001
Simple Squarewave Oscillator
==============

## Overview:
This is a down and dirty oscillator that you can use to test other circuits. 

No configuration pots or pins needed. 

**The tuning fork of sketches.**

The frequencies are fixed, so if you want some control over the sound, this is not what you are looking for.

Two High Frequency square waves, two LFO and a ramping frequency.
Note that the frequency here is not going to be exact. We are using the internal 8mhz clock..so you will see as much as +/- 15HZ on what the sketch says.  Its not too important here.  Again, we are just looking for a squarewave version of _Hello World_.

## Equivalent:

Mostly used to replace a 40106 oscillator for a quick audio check.

## Examples:
[Sample](https://soundcloud.com/user-692410397/85-0001a) Not really stellar.  Its just a square wave.  But at the end is the ramp.
