# ACS-85-0001
Simple Squarewave Oscillator
==============

## Overview:
This is a down and dirty oscillator that you can use to test other circuits. No configuration pots or pins needed.
The tuning fork of sketches.
The frequencies are fixed, so if you want some control over the sound, this is not what you are looking for.

Two High Frequency square waves, two LFO and a ramping frequency.

## Equivalent:

Mostly used to replace a 40106 oscillator for a quick audio check.

## Examples:
[Sample](https://soundcloud.com/user-692410397/85-0001a) Not really stellar.  Its just a square wave.  But at the end is the ramp.
