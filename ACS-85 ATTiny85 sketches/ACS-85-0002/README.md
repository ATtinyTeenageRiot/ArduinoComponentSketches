# ACS-85-0002
Two Frequency VCO
==============

## Overview:
Two controllable frequencies and a pin that is a two tone combination. Values from 0 to 5 volts on the input pins produces audio squarewaves on the output pins.
The final pin alternates between the two frequencies at a fixed interval. 

ACS-85-0003 allows you to play with the alternating frequencies more.
