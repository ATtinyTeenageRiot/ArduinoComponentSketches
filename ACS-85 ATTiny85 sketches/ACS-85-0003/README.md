# ACS-85-0003
Two Tone VCO with Speed Control
==============

## Overview:
Two adjustable Alternating frequencies with an adjustable speed.

In addition, there was an extra pin out, so I used it to play notes put together from
the difference between the frequencies.  It kinda ends up like a sample hold sound.
Easier to just hear it.

Ok..there is a bug in the picture above, but I cant find the SVG to fix it.  It should say PB0 not PB1.
