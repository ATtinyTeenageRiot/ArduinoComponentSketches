# ACS-85-0005
Three VCOs detuned
==============

## Overview:
One frequency control and one detuned
PB0 is the frequency
PB1 is the frequency - detune
PB2 is the freq - 2*detune

  Imagine 3 40106 squarewave generators.  All 3 driven by a 3 gang pot.
  Then, the second and third have another 3 gang pot with two of the deals in the third oscillator so that you have detune * 2.
