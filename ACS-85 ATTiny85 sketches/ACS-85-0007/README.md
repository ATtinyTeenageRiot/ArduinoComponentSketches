# ACS-85-0007
Squarewave with freq changes
==============

## Overview:
ATTiny85  Squarewave with variable frequncy.
The period changes in this case using counters. Each time the pin flips, the period is reduced or increased. The side of the increase is masked by 3,4 or 5 bits. Since the period increases, the frequncy decreases.  

Its much more of ramp sound for PB2
