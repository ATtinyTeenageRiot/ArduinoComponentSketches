Simple LFO
==============

## Overview:
PWM lfo outputs.
Has a triangle, ramp up, ramp down and sine.

The mode is selected with an analog pot.  A linear pot is best, but if you have a log pot you can change the code to handle that range

Set this value to 0 for non-linear

    #define MAP_VALUES_AS_LINEAR 1
