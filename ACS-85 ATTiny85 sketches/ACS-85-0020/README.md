 ATTiny85 Squarewave LFO with Duty Cycle

## Overview

Two inputs:

- Frequency
- Duty cycle

Three Outputs:

 - LFO as squarewave
 - !LFO as squarewave
 - LFO at 1/2 freq as squarewave

There is another pin that is putting out the LFO at 1/2 the freq, but thats just a free pin.

## Equivalent

A 555 circuit perhaps.  Note, my biggest beef with using a 555 is that the duty cycle is usually dependent on the frequency.
