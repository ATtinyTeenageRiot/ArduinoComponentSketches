# ACS-85-0352
Sample and Vibrato (ramps)
==============

## Overview:
Takes a medium to High frequnecy on pin 7 and outputs a squarewave with variable frequency and width.

Vibrato is when you modulate the frequency of the signal (as opposed to tremolo where you modulate the amplitude)

This is not as spectacular as I had hoped, but has promise.

Its basically still a riff on [ACS-85-0350](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0350)

## Strategy:

The basic strategy for ACS-85-0353 is the same as [ACS-85-0350](https://github.com/robstave/ArduinoComponentSketches/tree/master/ACS-85%20ATTiny85%20sketches/ACS-85-0350) 
 

## Improvements:
This could use some help.

Its just ramps. A triangle perhaps?
