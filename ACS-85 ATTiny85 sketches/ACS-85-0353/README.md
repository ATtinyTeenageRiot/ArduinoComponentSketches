# ACS-85-0352
Sample and modultate with LFSR
==============

## Overview:
Takes a medium to High frequnecy on pin 7 and outputs a squarewave with variable frequency and width.
Kinda like the frequency was modulated by a squarewave source.

The Width determines the size of the mask to add to the sampled frequency.
Speed is the duration of each step.
