# ACS-85-0360

Counter with selectable divisors 

## Overview

Counter that can divide an input by 8, 4, 2 or 1 and output with a duty of 50% or just one clock (trigger).

The intent was to use in series with a medium clock to make an LFO that you can press buttons to speed up by 2, 4 and 8.

At higher frequencies it will sound like an octave up or more.
