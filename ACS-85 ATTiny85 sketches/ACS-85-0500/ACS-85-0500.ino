 * ACS-85-0500
 * ATTiny85 Atari punk console
 * 
 * This is a pretty close approximation to the
 * APC.  It consists of two components.
 * The first is an oscillator.
 * when the oscillator changes down, it triggers a 
 * one shot.  When the one shot is finished, the first oscilllator is
 * free to trigger the one shot again.
 * 
 * without touching the knobs, its just a squarewave.  As you modify
 * the frequency or one shot length, you get a PWM/Aliasing effect.
 * 
 * Alas, the resolution as it stands makes an already underwhelming
 * thing into an 8-bit version that is more underwhelming.
 * 
 * it works..but could be improved.
 
 *
 * External pin 1       = Reset (not used)
 * External pin 2 (PB3) = Osc freq
 * External pin 3 (PB4) = one shot length
 * External pin 4       = GND
 * External pin 5 (PB0) = none
 * External pin 6 (PB1) = none
 * External pin 7 (PB2) = out
 * External pin 8       = Vcc

 *
 * V 1.0  -  First Version
 *   needs work. Tried to limit analogReads with millis, but that did not work.
 *   maybe there is a conflict w timer 0.
