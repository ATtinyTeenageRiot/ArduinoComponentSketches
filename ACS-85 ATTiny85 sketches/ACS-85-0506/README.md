# ACS-85-0506
Nand Synth DX
==============

## Overview:

Similar to many other Nand/40106 squarewave noise generators.  This has a single button to toggle through various
configurations.  The DX is because it reminds me of the DX7 and all the FM configurations you can scroll through.

There are Three knobs for Osc1, osc2 and osc3.  Osc 3 is an LFO and is not always used.
The button scrolls through all the configurations
