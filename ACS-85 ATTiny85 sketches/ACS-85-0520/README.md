# ACS-85-0520
16 Bit LFSR
==============

## Overview:
This is a down and dirty oscillator that you can use to test other circuits. 
The frequencies are fixed, so if you want some control over the sound, this is not the droid you are looking for.

## Equivalent:

Mostly used to replace a 40106 oscillator for a quick audio check.
