# ACS-85-0522
16 Bit LFSR LFO
==============

## Overview:
Linear Feedback Shift Register.
Low frequency, internal clocked.

Pretty much four taps of an LFSR so four pins that blink on and off randomly, but the same frequency.

See ACS-85-0521.


16 bit shift register that is externally clocked.  The values at certain taps are xor'ed together and feed back into the shift register.
The number of unique states should be 2^n -1.  In this case 2^16 -1 = 65535.

Can be used to produce pseudo random patterns. In this case, the last 4 taps are output to the pins to produce random 4 bit patterns.
To make this happen, we clock the LFSR 4x for every input clock so that all the bits in the nibble are pseudo randomized.

Exactly like to ACS-85-0521 except that the internal frequency is low.  The voltage on A1 determines the frequency of the LFSR.
The result is four pins that all sound similar as noise, but are different.  They are just different taps in the LFSR.
 

This is the same LFSR as is described in the wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register
