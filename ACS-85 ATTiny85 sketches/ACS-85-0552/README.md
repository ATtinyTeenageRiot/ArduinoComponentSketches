# ACS-85-0552
Melody Maker Upper 3
==============

## Overview:
One control for speed
Notes are played on three pins with each pin updating in a round robin fashion.
There are rests in this case and the notes go up and down.  Its a bit more melodic, but not too much more.

Similar to ACS-85-0550

AND/OR/XOR them or or just sum them using resistors

## Equivalent:
This is not like the 4017/4051 Melody Generator

## Examples:
This is a sample of all 3 pins summed up and playing at the same time.

One way to do this is similar to acs-85-0550

Here is a sample of just one of the pins (pb2)

## Improvement ideas.
There is a pin left.  Either as a mode input or and output (xor ?)
