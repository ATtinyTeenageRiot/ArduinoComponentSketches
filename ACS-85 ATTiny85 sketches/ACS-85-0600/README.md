Simple Sequencer with analog scene select
==============

## Overview:
I was going for a programmable LFO but pretty much ended with a very simple sequencer.

Two analog inputs.  

* Speed
* scene select

The scenes are hard coded in the form

```
    #define PATTERN_0_SIZE 8
    boolean  pattern_0[PATTERN_0_SIZE] = {HIGH, LOW, HIGH, LOW, HIGH, LOW, HIGH, LOW};
    #define PATTERN_1_SIZE 8
    boolean  pattern_1[PATTERN_1_SIZE] = { HIGH, HIGH, LOW, LOW, HIGH, LOW, HIGH, LOW};
```
	
The other pin is just the clock.

TODO: Maybe a sample of whats going on here. But, meh, its not too interested. Kinda abandoning this one.
