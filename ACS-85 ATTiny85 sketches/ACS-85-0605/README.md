# ACS-85-0605
1 bit waveform selector
==============

## Overview:
Clock driven.
three pins selects from one of 8 waveforms.
Meant for higher frequency sounds, however it is clocked, so you can go as low as you would like.

This is just a simple squarewave clocking the component and the wave forms are selected 0 - 7

This is PB2 of the ACS-85-0002 clocking the component.  There is a lot more going on in that signal.
