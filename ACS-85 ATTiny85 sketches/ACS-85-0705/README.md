Tap Tempo Square wave LFO
==============

## Overview:
Two buttons provide tap tempo capabilities for two lfo outputs.

## Strategy:
The loop is read every 10ms.  This allows us set up a two state type machine that we can use to debounce the switch.  Really we are reading the switch and once its high, we take the reading and ignore
everything after that until it is done and we find a different state 10 ms later.  Maybe its a debounce on the way out?

Here is a tremolo that uses an ardruino for a tap tempo.  He stuffed the whole nano in the box
