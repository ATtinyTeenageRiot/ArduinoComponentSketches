Button Select - Single pin
==============

## Overview:

Controller sketch that allows you to select pins with two buttons.  One for up and one for down.

The output is a single pin going high. See state diagrams.

There is an internal software switch that allows the states to wrap. This is declared at compile time and is not configurable in real time.
